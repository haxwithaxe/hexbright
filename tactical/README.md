Button press (less than 250 ms): Cycle between 3 brightnesses (high, medium, then low) and off.

If held for over 250 ms, go to strobe (15 hz or so, right where it's most uncomfortable).  Upon release of strobe, go to the previous light state.
Code to just shutdown after strobing is included, but commented out.
